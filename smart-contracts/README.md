Blockchain Integration (Web3)

Sampatti AI is future-proof. We have developed a suite of Smart Contracts to bring transparency and DeFi capabilities to mutual fund investing.

**Contracts (located in `/blockchain`):**
1.  **SampattiToken (SAM):** ERC-20 token for loyalty rewards and premium AI feature access.
2.  **PortfolioRegistry:** Uses IPFS & Hashing to store immutable snapshots of user portfolios, ensuring data integrity and "Proof of Returns".
3.  **SIPVault:** A DeFi-enabled SIP mechanism that uses smart contracts to handle lock-in periods (ELSS logic) on-chain.

**Tech Stack:** Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, Ethers.js.
